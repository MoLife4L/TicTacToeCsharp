# Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using C#. The program provides an interactive experience where two players can take turns marking their moves on the game board. The game features player switching, move validation, and a basic AI for determining the winner or a draw.

## Features

- Clear and interactive console-based UI.
- Two-player mode with alternating turns.
- Checks for winning conditions based on rows, columns, and diagonals.
- Proper input validation to ensure players can only choose available positions.
- Automatic game reset after a win or draw.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your C# development environment.
3. Run the program to start the game.
4. Players will be prompted to choose their moves by entering the corresponding numbers.
5. The game will continue until a player wins or the game results in a draw.

Feel free to explore the code to understand the logic and mechanics behind this implementation. It's a great way to demonstrate my C# programming skills and logical thinking in a fun and classic game context.
